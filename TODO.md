# TODOLIST

- Refactor screens to scenes/screens (scenes is all tab views, screens is all scenes content)
- Add background worker (to avoid network issues)
- Load from a local storage (AsyncStorage ?)
- Only diff from request and local. Stop displaying directly response from request
- Better error handling from network request (network error && server error) // add to types


## IDEA

- api external library ?
- Use neverthrow ?
